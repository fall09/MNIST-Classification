# MNIST-Classification

This project implements a neural network model to classify images from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Contents
- **MNIST.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow for data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, built into TensorFlow.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fall09/MNIST-Classification.git
   ```
2. Open the `MNIST.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model achieves approximately **98% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset.

## Installation
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
